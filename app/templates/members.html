                <h5>Bass Guitar</h5>

                <p>Justin started playing music yesterday. The bass guitar works well for him since he can
                    pretend to play and no one can tell the difference. He's hoping he never has a solo...</p>
                <p>Justin loves the outdoors. He and his wife are often on an adventure exploring northern Arizona.</p>

                <h5>Drums</h5>

                <p>Mitchell is an expert at the boring and repetitive.  Naturally, this makes playing the same 
                   three notes on the drums for every song a breeze.  With enough luck, he will never have to 
                   learn another note.</p>
                <p>Mitchell likes to spend his free time wherever he can find peace and silence.</p>

                <h5>Beat Sampler</h5>

                <p>Herbie is an experimentalist. He managed to live his whole life not hearing a single note of classical music until one
                he heard some Beethoven. After he heard it, he knew the world of hip hop and classical needed to join.</p>

                <p>He spents his time partying  it up! Or down or sideways.</p>
